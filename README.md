Just walked out... whoa, Snow White, man. Still have popcorn in my teeth and ffs, my back is killing from leaning on that sticky seat. Can’t believe the theater was that crowded, wasn’t it 10 am? The chitter-chatter and phone screens, like fireflies, kept me distracted. Or maybe it was just my brain buzzing, like a mad loop.

Witch, queen, whatever she's called — her mirror? Felt like the AI we’re all afraid of. Reflecting back not what’s real, but what someone wants to hear. Mind-bending. You know when the prince kissed Snow White, it was like solving a bug at 3 am, didn’t expect that to work, right?

> Those dwarfs, lol, System architects maybe? Grimy and all, singing while building their funny home. Can’t tell if I envy their synced work or just the harmony, the way orchestras sync their violins and trombones... I kept thinking, is anyone gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and find these weird details?

The whispers and giggles right behind me, honestly, louder than the Hi-Ho harmony. Felt like I was part of a live test run. Why does every seating make you feel like you were trying to write code blindfolded, with numbers floating around your ears?

Did you notice? when the apple hit the ground... rebound like a rogue wave, almost like accidentally refreshing the IDE without saving. I think I should tell Mark to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   like maybe next weekend.

Man, the colors — flood of warm pixels before breakfast kinda makes me doubt reality. Seriously, the colors stabbed forward while I was slouched, back hurting like an old hard drive.

Remember? Someone mentioned the queen transforming was this whisper-like hum, faded in sound and yet a deafening silence, all the same. Just like when headphones break.
